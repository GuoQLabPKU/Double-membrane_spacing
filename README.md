# Double-membrane_spacing
This MATLAB script is used to calculate the distance between two close membranes: membrane1 and membrane2 (e.g. double membrane of some organellels).
The output file 'memb_dist1.bild' shows double-membrane distances distribution can be read in Chimera software.

Notes: this script relies on TOM software toolbox, which contains essential function (e.i. tom_mrcread).
The package of TOM software toolbox can be fonud in this paper:
